# netscan.sh
A little script to do an nmap and pull out relevant information without flooding the terminal.
Currently this pulls out the hostname, ip address, latency and MAC of devices it finds, if that information is available

Of course, this can be done with nmap directly, but I constantly forget which arguments to put in.

Also note, in order for MAC Address to appear, remember to run in sudo.

Anyone who knows more bash than me PLEASE feel free to fix this up so it displays better, as I don't know bash!
